🚀 Plix Language v1.3 – Introducing Smart Mutability™
We’re proud to announce Plix v1.3, featuring the groundbreaking Smart Mutability™ system—a new paradigm in memory-safe programming that eliminates the friction between productivity and correctness.

🔒 What is Smart Mutability™?
No more mut or const declarations for local variables.
Plix now automatically infers mutability from your code—and guarantees memory safety at compile time using region-based lifetime analysis.

Write like Python.
Compile like Rust.
Run with confidence.

✨ Key Highlights
✅ Automatic mutability inference – declare with x = value, no keywords needed
✅ Compile-time aliasing safety – at most one mutable reference per value
✅ Clear, actionable error messages for unsafe patterns
✅ Full backward compatibility – existing mut/const syntax still works
✅ Zero runtime overhead – all checks happen during compilation
📚 Learn with Examples
We’ve included 5 educational examples to help you master Smart Mutability™:

smart_mut_basic.px – The basics
smart_mut_alias.px – Safe sharing
smart_mut_conflict.px – What not to do (and why it fails)
smart_mut_function.px – Safe function boundaries
smart_mut_struct.px – Object mutation with guarantees
🛠 Under the Hood
Region-based lifetime tracking via RegionGraph
Integrated into the type checker with minimal performance impact
Designed with ergonomics and safety as first-class concerns
Plix v1.3 redefines what it means to write safe, expressive code—without compromise.
